This repository implements a Movie Recommendation System using collaborative filtering techniques, specifically matrix factorization methods. The project is centered around building a personalized recommender that suggests movies to users based on their past preferences and the preferences of others. It utilizes a dataset containing user-movie ratings and applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or similar latent factor models to learn patterns in user behavior and movie attributes.
The workflow begins with loading and exploring the dataset, handling missing data, and transforming the user-item interaction matrix into a suitable format for matrix factorization. The code then trains a recommendation model by decomposing the matrix into user and item latent features, aiming to reconstruct the original ratings as accurately as possible. Evaluation is typically performed using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) on validation/test data to measure prediction accuracy. Finally, the model generates movie suggestions tailored to individual users by predicting which unseen items they are most likely to enjoy.

In summary, this project showcases an unsupervised learning application in a real-world domain (entertainment) using collaborative filtering. It demonstrates how to build a scalable recommender system that learns user preferences from implicit or explicit feedbackâ€”an essential technique in modern data-driven applications like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.
