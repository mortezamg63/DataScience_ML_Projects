This project is a machine learning regression analysis that aims to predict the price of diamonds using various physical and categorical attributes from the well-known Diamonds dataset. The workflow starts with loading the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables like carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions (x, y, z). Visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps are used to identify patterns and relationships between diamond features and price. Anomalies such as inconsistencies in expectations (e.g., lower-quality color/clarity yielding higher prices) are noted.

The categorical features (cut, color, clarity) are then encoded numerically, and correlation analysis is performed to inspect linear relationships. Features are analyzed through scatter plots and line plots to understand the influence of each dimension and carat weight on price. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, and two models are trained: a Decision Tree Regressor and a Random Forest Regressor. Both models are evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score, with Random Forest outperforming Decision Tree slightly in all metrics.

In summary, this notebook demonstrates a complete pipeline for predictive modeling in regression tasks, from EDA and preprocessing to model training and performance evaluation. It showcases how ensemble learning (Random Forest) improves prediction accuracy and provides insights into which features (like carat and dimensions) most significantly influence diamond pricing, while also highlighting possible data inconsistencies that simple models may not fully capture.
