This code performs an exploratory analysis on U.S. birth data from the CDC. It begins by loading and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values in the day column. Then, it aggregates birth counts by gender and decade to observe long-term trends, which are visualized using line and bar plots. Next, it filters out outliers in the birth data using robust statistical methods, converts the date components into a proper datetime format, and extracts the day of the week. Finally, it analyzes and visualizes average births per weekday across decades, revealing that births tend to be lower on weekends. Overall, the code provides insight into birth patterns over time and by weekday.
