This code implements a fake news detection system using a machine learning pipeline based on text classification. It begins by loading a dataset (news.csv) that contains news articles labeled as either FAKE or REAL. The text content of each article is vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert raw text into numerical features suitable for modeling. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets.

A PassiveAggressiveClassifier, which is well-suited for large-scale online learning and classification tasks, is trained on the TF-IDF features. After training, it predicts labels on the test set and achieves an accuracy of 92.82%, with a confusion matrix showing how well it distinguishes between FAKE and REAL news.

To explore alternative models, the code also trains a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network classifier. With early stopping and a limit of 300 iterations, the MLP achieves a comparable accuracy of 92.5%, indicating both models are effective in this classification task. Overall, this project demonstrates a robust and interpretable approach to detecting misinformation in news articles using machine learning.
