The provided code is a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting home loan approval status using a dataset from a Kaggle competition. It begins with loading and exploring the data, performing univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between features and the target variable (Loan_Status). Then, it conducts data cleaning by handling missing values and treats skewness and outliers using log transformations. The code performs feature engineering to create new relevant variables (TotalIncome, EMI, Balance_Income) that better capture a borrower's ability to repay the loan. After transforming categorical variables into numeric using one-hot encoding, it prepares the data for model training. Several classification models are built and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Grid Search with Random Forest, and XGBoost, with performance comparison based on prediction accuracy. Finally, the model identifies feature importance using the Random Forest model, highlighting Credit_History and Balance_Income as the most significant predictors.

In short, this project demonstrates a typical end-to-end workflow for a binary classification taskâ€”from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretation. It offers a clear, practical example of how machine learning can be applied to real-world decision-making problems in finance.
