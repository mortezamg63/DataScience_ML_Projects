The code implements a Spam SMS Message Classifier using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The project begins by reading a dataset of labeled SMS messages (ham or spam), followed by label encoding of the target variable and text preprocessing, which includes removing emails, URLs, currency symbols, phone numbers, punctuation, and stop words. Then it applies stemming to reduce words to their root forms. The cleaned messages are tokenized and converted into a bag-of-words representation, and the top 1500 most frequent words are used as features for classification.

The messages and their corresponding labels are paired and split into training and testing sets. Several classifiers from scikit-learn (wrapped via NLTK's SklearnClassifier) are trained, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. The SVM model achieves the highest accuracy (~98.7%), and the report shows that the model effectively distinguishes between spam and ham messages with high precision and recall.

In summary, this project is an end-to-end implementation of a binary text classification system that showcases the combination of NLP preprocessing techniques and supervised machine learning models to accurately detect spam messages. It demonstrates data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and comparison across multiple algorithms.
